libsecp256k1
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bitcoin-core/secp256k1.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bitcoin-core/secp256k1)

Optimized C library for EC operations on curve secp256k1.

This library is a work in progress and is being used to research best practices. Use at your own risk.

Features:
* secp256k1 ECDSA signing/verification and key generation.
* Adding/multiplying private/public keys.
* Serialization/parsing of private keys, public keys, signatures.
* Constant time, constant memory access signing and pubkey generation.
* Derandomized DSA (via RFC6979 or with a caller provided function.)
* Very efficient implementation.

Implementation details
----------------------

* General
  * No runtime heap allocation.
  * Extensive testing infrastructure.
  * Structured to facilitate review and analysis.
  * Intended to be portable to any system with a C89 compiler and uint64_t support.
  * Expose only higher level interfaces to minimize the API surface and improve application security. ("Be difficult to use insecurely.")
* Field operations
  * Optimized implementation of arithmetic modulo the curve's field size (2^256 - 0x1000003D1).
    * Using 5 52-bit limbs (including hand-optimized assembly for x86_64, by Diederik Huys).
    * Using 10 26-bit limbs.
  * Field inverses and square roots usin
